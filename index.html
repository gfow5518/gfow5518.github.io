<p><em>Leif Erikson does have a day, <br>
October 9th to be exact,<br>
Proclaimed throughout the U.S.A.<br>
He did beat Columbus in fact,<br>
As first European to come <br>
To the New World to 'civilize, <br>
But gets less credit, so say some, <br> 
Because his trip did not give rise <br>
To European migration, <br>
In mass to a new time and place, <br>
With old conquering to be done. <br>
Columbus' trips ballooned that pace. <br>
<br>
A pagan Viking - just no way <br>
To get a Federal holiday.</em> </p>
